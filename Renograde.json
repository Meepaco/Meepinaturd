    "Starting off, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Charlotte Perkins Gillman employ character in “Young Goodman Brown” and “The Yellow Wallpaper” in order to display one’s personal beliefs morphing into drastically different realities. Primarily, this is evident when Goodman Brown enters the forest; the ignorant character dismisses his intuition on the dangers of entering the forest and finding ${pholder}, propelling the narrative to the creation of the false reality. Under these circumstances, in the vast forest, Brown warns himself there is a high possibility of “a devilish Indian behind every tree” (Hawthorne 1), although he continues on regardless. Furthermore, John, the husband, stands on the static ideology of his ill spouse’s best treatment is of isolation in the house, which consecutively results in realization of the untrue reality he embeds himself into. To illustrate, he observes her “creeping [around the room] just the same, but [she] looked at him over [her] shoulder” (Gillman 9), then questioning her bizarre actions, and eventually fainting after coming to the conclusion of her severely degrading mental state. In both passages, a false reality emerges as a direct result of an individual’s beliefs, resulting in negative consequences due to one’s judgement. By ignoring his own warnings of imminent danger, Brown encounters evil spirits in the alternate reality. His life forever changes after the exposure to the traumatizing events; he ponders of subjects differently with a high level of paranoia. John arrives to the realization that his beliefs of isolation are deceitful, impacting his wife negatively instead of curing her of the condition during their stay. The false reality he creates from his personal and societal beliefs of the era is not the true reality. In closure, Charlotte Perkins Gillman and Nathaniel Hawthorne use character in order to convey the concept of personal beliefs authorizing the construction of false realities.",
    "Continuing on, the authors manipulate the application of perspective in both “Young Goodman Brown” and “The Yellow Wallpaper” to enforce untrue realities emerging from one’s improper beliefs. To exhibit, although in third-person, “Young Goodman Brown” is in expression solely from Brown’s limited perspective, thus his personal accounts and beliefs further advance the superstition of evil, creating the alternate reality. On the day after “the dream of evil omen” (Hawthorne 6), Brown returns to the real world, away from the evil presence he encounters in the darkness of the forest. Similarly, limited perspective enhances the imaginary realm in regards to the wallpaper; they develop a whole new fictional world taking place within. To indicate, the wallpaper displays entities that “nobody will know but [the speaker], or ever will… [with] the dim shapes getting clearer every day and containing ${pholder}” (Gillman 5), eventually developing to a full immersive experience for the speaker. In both stories, the speaker is demonstrating many elements of limited perspective, with degrading mental states triggering hallucinations; therefore, distorting the reality as the narrative progresses. Goodman Brown undergoes surreal events resembling hallucinations in a dream as the result of the immense paranoia of venturing into the forest. Brown’s paranoia enhances this surreal environment as only one’s own imagination are capable of composing fears that are unmatchable to fearful elements of another entity. Moving on, essentially being from first person accounts, “The Yellow Wallpaper” has a limited perspective. The scenes on display on the wallpaper are simply hallucinations by the speaker, showcasing her untrue beliefs, asserting into a false reality behind the wallpaper. In conclusion, “Young Goodman Brown” and “The Yellow Wallpaper” by Hawthorne and Gillman use restrictive perspective, enhancing the matter of false realities directly arising from an individual’s beliefs.",
